# Sheath Rot Disease Detection in Rice using Pretrained VGG19

This project demonstrates the use of transfer learning with the VGG19 convolutional neural network to detect sheath rot disease in rice plants from leaf images.

## Overview

The notebook `Rice-Plant-Sheath-Rot-Disease-Detection-VGG19.ipynb` covers:
- Loading and preprocessing an image dataset of rice plant leaves (both healthy and diseased)
- Using the pre-trained VGG19 model for feature extraction (transfer learning)
- Fine-tuning the model to classify images as healthy or sheath rot diseased
- Training, validating, and evaluating the model
- Visualizing the model's performance, including accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrix
